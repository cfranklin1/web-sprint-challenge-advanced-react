# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
    - Functional components are just JavaScript functions, taking in optional props; are easy to wriite, understand, and test; can avoid the this keyword; can be defined in a single-line using arrow function syntax; can also be created using a class, if a hook is needed
    - Stateful components are always class components, they offer more features and can have state that gets initialized and updated
2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?
    
3. Define stateful logic.
    - logic built into a component (a function that handles click event or toggles state or formats data before displayed)

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
